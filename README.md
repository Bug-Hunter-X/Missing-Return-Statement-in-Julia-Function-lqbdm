# Julia Bug: Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a missing `return` statement in a function that has multiple branches.  The function `myfunction` correctly handles positive and negative inputs, but fails to return a value when the input is zero, leading to undefined behavior.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.jl` file provides the corrected code with the added `return` statement.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.jl` and run the code using the Julia REPL.
3. Observe the unexpected output for `myfunction(0)`.
4. Open `bugSolution.jl` and run the corrected code. Observe the consistent output.
